 <div class="container day-1">
  <img src="images/1.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o1">Today was our travel day. We flew from San Francisco to New York.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-2">
  <img src="images/2.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o2">This was our second travel day. Once we arrived in Havana, we drove to Matanzas,Cuba and got introduced to Casa farfan, where we would be spending the next several days.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-3">
  <img src="images/3.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o3">Today, we were introduced to the facility that we would be painting for the next few days: a facility for disabled people (primarily children). We spent most of the day painting the outside of the facility and the cafeteria.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-4">
  <img src="images/4.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o4">Today, we painted more of the facility, this time primarily focusing on the halls, along with talking to some of the children (using Graham's translations).</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-5">
  <img src="images/5.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o5">We finished painting the facility early today, so that we could talk with our "Cuban tour guides" Alex and Jalla about Cuba and some questions we had about Cuba. During this discussion, an anonymous person asked Alex and Jalla about their opinions on the Cuban government. Alex and Jalla did not answer this, so later we talked about freedom of speech and how we are lucky to live in a country where we can say what we want about our government.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-6">
  <img src="images/6.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o6">Today, Alex, Jalla, Graham, Mikki, and Lauren surprised us by taking us to the Bay of Pigs to snorkel. One thing that was interesting to me about this area was that there were no signs denoting the invasion that occured many years ago. There was only one sign that said "This is where they were stopped". My theory on why this is, is that either Cuba's government or the local people do not want to think about an invasion that could have wiped out Cuba if it was better organized.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-7">
  <img src="images/7.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o7">We taught English to some children in a part of rural central Cuba. I realized how fortunate I am to not live in place like this town, where there are very few educational oppurtinuties for children.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-8">
  <img src="images/8.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o8">We got food from different places in the town that we had visited yesterday, and we distributed the food to families that could use the help. One thing I found interesting about this process is the fact that everyone is so close in the town, that there is no sign denoting a place to buy meat or a market. The residents of the town just know where to get everything.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-9">
  <img src="images/9.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o9">Today, we drove from Matanzas to Veradero Beach, where we spent the day relaxing on the beach. One cool fact that I learned is that Veradero Beach is the closest point in Cuba to Florida.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-10">
  <img src="images/10.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o10">We ate breakfast and said goodbye to Veradero Beach, before going on a three hour bus ride to Havana, Cuba. Another cool fact that I learned today is that there are Cuban people living in 121 other countries!</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-11">
  <img src="images/11.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o11">Today, we took a car tour around Havana city. In Cuba, cars may look old, but as I learned on the trip, some of them have new engines and other parts in them from countries like Japan and Russia.</div>
 </div>
 <div class="container day-12">
  <img src="images/12.jpg" />
  <div class="overlay o12">Today, we said goodbye to Cuba and left on a flight back to San Francisco. In conclusion, Cuba is one of the most unique places in the world, and you can learn a lot of unexpected things by traveling to a new country and paying close enough attention.</div>
